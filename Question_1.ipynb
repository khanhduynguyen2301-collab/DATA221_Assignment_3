    "# Looking at the mean and median, we notice that the mean is larger than the median (0.44119122257053295 > 0.39). Therefore, the distribution will be skewed, especially right-skewed. To explain this, we know a right-skewed distribution has a longer tail on the right side, which indicates that there is a few large values on the right tail and it pulls the mean upward. This results in the larger mean value compared to the median.\n",
